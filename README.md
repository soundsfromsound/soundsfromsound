- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @soundsfromsound. Welcome to my GitHub!

I am a composer, sound designer, and educator based in Boston, MA. 
I use LilyPond to engrave my compositions and you'll find a lot of code snippets here, as well as various config files. I also will be uploading my full scores here in the future.
